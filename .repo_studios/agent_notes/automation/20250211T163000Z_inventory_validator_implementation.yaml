summary: "Implemented the initial inventory validation CLI and regression tests for schema compliance."

  phase: "phase-1-step-1"

observations:
  - "Validator enforces required fields, list typing, enum membership, dependency structure, and unique ids across catalogs."
  - "Helper modules break out list/enum/dependency checks to keep complexity low and future friendly."
  - "Test suite covers success path, duplicate id failure, and JSON report serialization." 
decisions:
  - "Expose CLI via Python entry point to integrate with Make targets later."
  - "Store validator outputs as stdout (plain or JSON) for downstream automation consumption."
next_steps:
  - "Integrate validator into Makefile (`studio-validate-inventory`) and document usage in repo docs."
  - "Expand tests with fixtures covering dependency path edge cases and optional fields."
