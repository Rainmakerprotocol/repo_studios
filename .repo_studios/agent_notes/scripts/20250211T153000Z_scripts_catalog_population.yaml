summary: "Inventoried legacy scripts into standards, health, and utility catalogs following inventory schema."
context:
  phase: "phase-1-step-1"
  focus_area: scripts_catalog
  related_tasks:
    - inventory_schema_population
    - migration_readiness
observations:
  - "Standards tooling tightly coupled to legacy `.copilot_instructions` paths that require redirection."
  - "Health suite assets span diagnostics, typing, and monkey patch monitoring; grouped for orchestrator planning."
  - "Utility validators share documentation governance concerns and will link to docs catalog."
decisions:
  - "Track each script with unique `scripts.<group>.<name>` ids for migration traceability."
  - "Leave dependencies empty arrays when unknown to maintain schema compatibility."
next_steps:
  - "Populate test inventories mirroring script grouping structure."
  - "Map shared helper modules to avoid duplication across catalogs."
