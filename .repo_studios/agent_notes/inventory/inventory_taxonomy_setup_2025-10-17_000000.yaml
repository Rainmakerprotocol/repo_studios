summary: >-
  Created the structured `agent_notes/` workspace with topic-based subfolders,
  README guidance, and a reusable YAML template to support future timestamped
  logs.
details:
  - Added subfolders for automation, governance, inventory, meta, migration, reports, standards, and templates to keep entries organized.
  - Documented usage conventions in `agent_notes/README.md`, including filename patterns and required metadata fields.
  - Published `_templates/note_template.yaml` as a starter skeleton for new notes.

  context: >-
    Initial step for Phase 1 to ensure the knowledge base is structured for
    AI-first retrieval.
  decisions:
    - Chose topic-based subfolders to align with planned workstreams (inventory, migration, automation, etc.).
    - Opted for ISO-8601 timestamps and stable filenames with metadata in headers to simplify versioning.
