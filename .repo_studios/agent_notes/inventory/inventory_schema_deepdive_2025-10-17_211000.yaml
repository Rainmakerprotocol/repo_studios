title: "Inventory schema artifacts formalized"
timestamp: "2025-10-17T21:10:00Z"
author: copilot
phase: phase-1-foundation
summary: >-
  Converted the schema draft into concrete reference materials (spec doc,
  machine-readable enums, entry template) to support future validation tooling
  and catalog population.
details:
  - Authored `docs/inventory_schema_spec.md` describing every field, enum, and validation rule with examples.
  - Published `.repo_studios/inventory_schema/enums.yaml` to give agents a single source for enumerated values.
  - Added `.repo_studios/inventory_schema/inventory_entry_template.yaml` so new catalog entries can be authored consistently.
  - Ensured markdown formatting meets lint requirements (headings, code fences, bullet spacing).
inputs:
  sources:
    - path: agent_notes/inventory/inventory_schema_draft_2025-10-17_204200.yaml
      description: Schema structure established in the previous step.
outputs:
  artifacts:
  - path: .repo_studios/docs/inventory_schema_spec.md
      description: Canonical schema specification.
    - path: .repo_studios/inventory_schema/enums.yaml
      description: Machine-readable enumerations for schema fields.
    - path: .repo_studios/inventory_schema/inventory_entry_template.yaml
      description: Fill-in template for inventory records.
status: complete
follow_up:
  - Implement automated validation commands that read the spec/enums (future phase).
  - Confirm whether additional enums (e.g., governance flags) should be centralized.
tags:
  - inventory
  - schema
  - documentation
  - phase1
notes:
  context: "Deeper pass within Step 1 to create durable schema references."
  decisions:
    - Store enums separately for easy reuse across validators and generators.
    - Provide a documented template to reduce friction when populating the catalog.
