phase: phase-1-foundation
summary: >-
  Defined how Repo Studios scripts will be inventoried, grouped by function, and
  stored under dedicated schema folders.
details:
  - Create grouped catalogs under `.repo_studios/inventory_schema/scripts/` for standards tooling, health/report generators, and utility/validation helpers.
  - Apply the inventory template with roles, maturity, consumers, and migration notes for each script.
  - Document dependencies (internal paths, external tools) when known; otherwise leave arrays empty for later enrichment.
  - Ensure each catalog highlights scripts requiring refactors (hard-coded paths, legacy dependencies) in the `notes` section.
inputs:
  sources:
    - path: .repo_studios_legacy/repo_scripts/
      description: Source directory for legacy scripts.
outputs:
  artifacts: []
status: complete
follow_up:
  - Populate `scripts/standards.yaml`, `scripts/health_reports.yaml`, and `scripts/utilities.yaml` with inventory entries.
  - Capture additional notes if new groupings emerge (e.g., nightly automation).
tags:
  - inventory
  - scripts
  - phase1
notes:
  context: "Preparation for detailed script mapping."
  decisions:
    - Store grouped catalogs in dedicated folders per request.
