phase: phase-1-foundation
summary: >-
  Captured every Repo Studios guidance file—legacy and new—into the inventory
  schema using the freshly defined template, including migration guidance and
  consumer roles.
details:
  - Added 22 entries to `.repo_studios/inventory_schema/docs_catalog.yaml` covering legacy standards, prompts, and the new build plan/alignment docs.
  - Annotated each record with roles, maturity, consumer targets, and migration notes to flag future actions.
  - Highlighted documents that should merge or elevate (e.g., mission parameters, alignment ledger) in their `notes` blocks.
inputs:
  sources:
    - path: .repo_studios_legacy/repo_docs/
      description: Legacy documentation corpus.
    - path: .repo_studios/
      description: New alignment/build plan documents.
outputs:
  artifacts:
    - path: .repo_studios/inventory_schema/docs_catalog.yaml
      description: Machine-readable mapping of all documentation assets.
status: complete
follow_up:
  - Repeat the process for scripts, reports, tests, and configs.
  - Use catalog entries to guide folder reorganization in later phases.
tags:
  - inventory
  - documentation
  - phase1
notes:
  context: "Documentation portion of comprehensive inventory mapping."
  decisions:
    - Keep status `needs_review` for legacy docs until migration tasks are done.
    - Mark living documents (alignment protocol, build plan, inventory spec) as `active` and `incubating` maturity.
