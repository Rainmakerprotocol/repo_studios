phase: phase-1-foundation
summary: >-
  Established the approach for representing every Repo Studios asset in the
  inventory, beginning with documentation and extending to scripts, reports, and
  tests.
details:
  - Produce category-specific catalogs (`docs_catalog.yaml`, `scripts_catalog.yaml`, etc.) derived from the legacy workspace and new `.repo_studios/` assets.
  - Use the canonical schema template so each entry captures roles, maturity, consumers, and migration guidance.
  - Capture insights and open questions in accompanying agent notes per category.
  - Flag items needing reformatting or upgrades (e.g., report structures) in the `notes` block for future phases.
