summary: "Cataloged legacy test suite coverage for health and fault diagnostics, mapping gaps to migration blockers."
context:
  phase: "phase-1-step-1"
  focus_area: tests_catalog
  related_tasks:
    - inventory_schema_population
    - migration_readiness
observations:
  - "Health suite tests dynamically import `.repo_studios` targets that have not yet been relocated, creating immediate blockers."
  - "Multiple test files remain placeholders with empty bodies, reflecting lost regression coverage."
  - "Fault diagnostics coverage depends on the same artifact pipeline slated for refactor."
decisions:
  - "Grouped tests by health and fault domains to mirror script catalogs for cross-referencing."
  - "Flagged missing target modules in blockers to drive migration backlog."
next_steps:
  - "Author migration plan to restore `.repo_studios` script entry points referenced by tests."
  - "Backfill assertions for empty placeholder tests once scripts stabilize."
