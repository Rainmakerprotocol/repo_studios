# Phase 1 Foundation Review

- **Timestamp:** 2025-10-18T01:38:00Z
- **Participants:** coding_agent
- **Related Tickets:** N/A

## Context

- Audit Phase 1 tasks in `repo_studios_build_plan.md` to verify completion status after recent inventory and standards updates.

## Actions

- Confirmed inventory pipeline produces `reports/<topic>/latest/` artifacts with extended metadata (paths, artifact types, dashboard metrics).
- Verified validator enforces path existence and respects `validator_config.yaml` with no suppressions; `make -C .repo_studios studio-validate-inventory` passes.
- Inspected documentation scaffolding: `docs/standards/global/`, `docs/standards/project/`, naming conventions, and templates for agent notes + structural checklists.
- Reviewed migrated standard `std-global-prompt-engineering.md` to ensure metadata header matches new guidance.

## Outcomes

- Phase 1 steps now have the following status:
  - **Inventory Schema:** complete for core functionality; future enhancements limited to optional dashboards/CI wiring.
  - **Directory Layout Confirmation:** complete.
  - **Documentation Scope Split:** scaffolding in place with at least one global standard migrated; remaining legacy standards still to port and tag with owners.
  - **Naming Conventions:** complete and documented.
  - **Plan Artifacts:** complete with reusable templates published.
- Documentation (`inventory_reports.md`, `naming_conventions.md`, build plan) reflects the latest structure.

## Follow-up

- [ ] Migrate remaining legacy standards into `docs/standards/global/` or `docs/standards/project/` and assign owners.
- [ ] Define CI health checks that consume `reports/summary/latest/*.json` artifacts.
- [ ] Expand secondary views (dependency graphs, trend snapshots) once consumers are identified.
