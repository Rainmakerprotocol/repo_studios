# Directory Layout Reference

Last updated: 2025-10-17

The `.repo_studios/` subtree now uses concise folder names so agents and humans can navigate predictably. The table below captures the active structure alongside legacy naming for cross-reference.

## Current Structure

- `docs/` – canonical documentation authored for Repo Studios (plans, specs, guides).
- `scripts/` – executable automation entry points (validators, view generators, future CLIs).
- `reports/` – reserved for generated summaries and artifacts that are safe to regenerate from source catalogs.
- `tests/` – automated test suites scoped to Repo Studios tooling.
- `inventory_schema/` – authoritative schema specification, enums, catalogs, and rendered views.
- `agent_notes/` – timestamped activity logs and implementation breadcrumbs.

## Legacy Mapping

| Legacy path | Current path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.repo_studios/repo_docs/` | `.repo_studios/docs/` | Rename applied; existing documents moved. Legacy references remain in historical notes for provenance. |
| `.repo_studios/tools/` | `.repo_studios/scripts/` | Rename applied; update automation invocations to the new path. |
| `.repo_studios/repo_reports/` | `.repo_studios/reports/` | Legacy directory retained read-only under `.repo_studios_legacy/`; new location will host regenerated views. |
| `.repo_studios/repo_tests/` | `.repo_studios/tests/` | Legacy assets still live in `.repo_studios_legacy/`. New work lands directly under `tests/`. |

## Operational Notes

- Historical assets remain accessible in `.repo_studios_legacy/` with their original `repo_*` naming. Treat that tree as read-only until migration is complete.
- Update automation, documentation, and inventory entries to reference the new paths when touching active files.
- Secondary views generated by `scripts/render_inventory_views.py` should be filed under `reports/` once reporting automation is expanded.

## Reports Roadmap

- **Phase 1 (current):** Keep generated YAML/JSON summaries in `inventory_schema/views/` so the validator can inspect them while the migration plan matures.
- **Phase 2 (after validator suppression work):** Introduce topic-specific subfolders such as `reports/docs/`, `reports/scripts/`, and `reports/tests/`; adjust the renderer to publish into those locations while leaving a pointer in `inventory_schema/views/` for backward compatibility.
- **Phase 3 (reporting automation expansion):** Retire the temporary `inventory_schema/views/` copies once CI dashboards and consumers read directly from `reports/<topic>/latest/`; archive historical runs under `reports/<topic>/timeline/`.
