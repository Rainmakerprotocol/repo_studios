# Inventory Secondary Views

Derived views in this folder are generated by `.repo_studios/scripts/render_inventory_views.py`. They provide read-only summaries of the authoritative catalogs so agents can quickly scan asset coverage without duplicating source data.

Current outputs:

- `docs_overview.yaml` – distilled list of documentation entries with maturity, status, consumers, and tags.
- `scripts_overview.yaml` – script catalog summary highlighting roles, maturity, and relationships.
- `tests_overview.yaml` – mapping of test coverage to related assets.
- `summary.json` – aggregate counts by asset kind, maturity, and status.

Regenerate views via:

```bash
python3 .repo_studios/scripts/render_inventory_views.py
```

Future iterations will expand the view set (e.g., dashboards, HTML reports) as migration work progresses.
