# Documentation Inventory Notes

Date: 2025-10-01

Status: Draft

Phase: Discovery

## Summary

* Inventory includes 2,738 documentation artifacts in scope.
* Exclusions cover `external/`, `src/`, `libraries/`, and any `logs` directories.
* Oldest doc: `models/whisper/voice_input.wav.txt` (2025-07-18).
* Newest doc: `.repo_studios/docs_inventory.md` (2025-10-01).
* Total footprint is about 1.27 GiB across Markdown, text, notebooks, and JSON content.
* `.repo_studios/` contributes roughly 84% of entries.

## Observations

* `.repo_studios/health_suite/` runs create many status artifacts with limited long-term value.
* `docs/` (170 files) and `mrp/` (93 files) appear current through September 2025.
* `memory-bank/` governance content covers 31 focused items for review.
* Voice subsystem docs document latency, queue smoothing, prompt policy, and feature
  flags; all align with offline-first design but require metric verification.
* `artifacts/` and `.github/` still anchor historical tracking data.
* Operator quickstart and fault owner signal docs give measurable escalation paths but
   still cite legacy pager IDs that need roster review.
* TTL registry refresh windows and memory staleness policy disagree, signalling a
   pending decision on authoritative cadence.
* Architecture and cache migration docs confirm cache facade sunset yet leave feature
   flag naming placeholders to verify.
* RAG standards outline embed refresh cadence without a matching Prometheus metric.
* Agents Step 3-5 plans plus the agent frameworks guide document ready scaffolds with
   flags, metrics, and MRP integration that complement existing orchestrator work.
* Service manifest spec proposes a declarative rollout contract but still lacks a
   validator or schema enforcement tooling.
* Voice conversation and privacy policies reiterate offline-first expectations and
   retention controls that should align with chat logging guidance.
* Monitoring overview, repo insight workflow, and startup runbook describe step-by-step
   troubleshooting flows that can feed the alignment ledger audit trail.
* Orchestrator overview plus perf/cache/memory/voice deep dive connect readiness probes,
   cache TTL validation, and memory health instrumentation that underpin recent Make targets.
* Node-RED, micro-agent, monitoring, and AI standards roadmaps supply living governance docs
   that depend on pending follow-ups (offline bundles, build scripts, rollout metrics).
* Service management addendum extends readiness orchestration with new flags and registries yet
   remains unsynced with the base phase documentation.
* ADR set (0001-0009) now codifies streaming policy, cache segmentation, diagnostics
   decomposition, event bus primacy, and dynamic agent imports; ADR 0008 still needs rationale
   and consequence sections.
* Metrics schema v4, phase histogram design, lifecycle events, and doc templates formalize data
   contracts and documentation structure but require matching alerts and template adoption.
* Core standards set (glossary, coding, testing, documentation, file tree) now clustered with
   lifecycle versioning and additive observability policies, giving a single governance surface
   for naming, drift guards, and change control.
* Voice orchestration docs (contract suite, intent router, meeting mode, quickstart) consolidate
   flag behavior, privacy guardrails, and CI contract coverage for conversation/meeting rollouts.
* Operations playbooks (flag matrix, restart policy, shutdown guide, test flag safety, exit code
   stability) define lifecycle supervision but still depend on unimplemented flags and deprecation
   sequencing.
* RAG endpoints + MRP README pair runtime observability with refresh operations, yet monitoring
   docs lack matching alerts; warmers extension remains conceptual without registry helper wiring.
* Batch 7 (docs 126-150) confirms lifecycle instrumentation is widely documented: UI memory widget
   guidance matches Chainlit standards, service management plan mirrors recent code progress, and
   logging/restart policies now align with lifecycle metrics and debug artifacts. Several docs still
   flag pending automation (startup benchmarks, debug dumps, systemd manifest).
* Events guide repeats ACL/redaction sections; consolidating the guidance would simplify ongoing
   maintenance while keeping security advice authoritative.
* Known issues tracker, observability roadmap, and systemd inventory governance are in scaffold
   mode; each calls for operational follow-up (issue intake, roadmap execution, manifest checks).
* Systemd inventory and security profile drafts couple classification heuristics with directive
   severity enforcement but both hinge on validators that are still pending implementation.
* Watchdog rollout recommendations lay out metrics, staged rollout, and shim retirement gates that
   depend on new instrumentation and python-systemd availability.
* Root-level docs (README, release notes, maintenance plan, retros) provide governance anchors but
   still depend on future integrity tooling, owner assignments, and metrics alerts to close the loop.

## Action Items

1. Limit future inventories by excluding generated `.repo_studios/` artifacts when appropriate.
   Baseline filter now captured in `docs_inventory_config.yaml` to drop health-suite
   outputs; revisit for additional directories.
2. Review residual docs in `models/` and `ledger_tmp/`; archive or drop any non-doc payloads.
3. Tag `docs/ci_fault_owner_signals.md`, `docs/memory/*`, and `memory-bank/*` for the next parsing slice.
4. Define a retention policy for `.repo_clean_log` entries created by automated runs.
5. Update `memory-bank/activeContext.md` and `memory-bank/progress.md` once the
   alignment ledger cycle supersedes cache TTL work statements.
6. Confirm monitoring dashboards expose `/metrics/voice` counters to close the loop
   with voice latency and collapse docs.
7. Revisit `docs/ui/bench_ui_pre_commit.md` against current Chainlit widget standards
   and plan revisions if hashing guidance has shifted.
8. Validate faulthandler blocklist/allowlist artifacts against
   `repo_rollout_targets.md` milestones ahead of the mid-term review.
   9. Reconcile operator quickstart pager IDs and fault owner signals with the current
      on-call roster and escalation sequence.
   10. Decide on a unified refresh cadence that satisfies both TTL registry windows and
       the memory staleness policy, then document it.
   11. Verify cache migration feature flag names and update the artifact policy with
       hybrid storage retention thresholds.
   12. Draft a Prometheus recording rule for memory embed refresh to close the gap in the
       RAG standards observability section.
   13. Stand up service manifest validation tooling (schema + CLI) before treating the
      spec as authoritative for deployments.
   14. Align chat logging retention knobs with voice logging policy to keep rotation and
      privacy guidance consistent.
   15. Document RAG status alerting guidance in monitoring docs so staleness signals are
      actionable.
   16. Track AI standards roadmap deliverables (schema, build script, CLI) and note any
      missing artifacts for follow-up.
   17. Merge the service management addendum back into the base Step 6 doc and plan verification
      tests for the new readiness metrics and shutdown snapshot features.
   18. Finish ADR 0008 sections (rationale, consequences, observability, rollback) so deprecation
      policy is actionable and update `docs/decisions.md` accordingly.
   19. Expand the scale-out systemd roadmap with concrete acceptance criteria, owners, and a flag
      rollout plan before scheduling multi-node work.
   20. Capture monitoring alert rules or PromQL snippets for the metrics introduced in
      `docs/metrics_schema.md` and `docs/metrics/phase_histogram_design.md` to close observability
      gaps.
   21. Flesh out the warmers extension guide with concrete registry helper usage, timeout defaults,
      and metric hooks that tie into lifecycle metrics tests.
   22. Implement lifecycle/additive observability drift guard enforcement (hash snapshots + CI)
      and document the guard location once active.
   23. Define supervisor restart env knobs (`SUP_RESTART_*`), assign ownership, and add acceptance
      tests so the restart policy is actionable.
   24. Add monitoring roadmap entries for `/rag/status` thresholds and `X-RAG-*` header sampling,
      then publish alert snippets in lifecycle metrics inventory.
   25. Outline a strict-mode/deprecation rollout for dangerous/test-only flags and exit codes,
      referencing updates in `docs/decisions.md` and exit code policy.
   26. Verify lifecycle metrics emitted by the orchestrator match the documented names/labels and
      land in `/metrics`; add targeted tests or doc updates if mismatches surface.
   27. Assign ownership for lifecycle startup benchmark automation (cold vs warm segregation,
      histogram guide) and tie deliverables to the observability roadmap.
   28. Deduplicate ACL/redaction guidance in `docs/agents/events.md` to keep the security section
      single-sourced.
   29. Expand `docs/operations/known_issues_tracker.md` with current issues or document the intake
      workflow so the tracker becomes actionable.
   30. Implement the planned systemd inventory integrity manifest and drift check target before
      promoting to blocking enforcement.
   31. Wire startup debug dump generation into the orchestrator (flag + automatic failure capture)
      and ship the diff helper script promised in the artifact spec.
   32. Implement watchdog counters/gauges plus baseline PromQL alerts as outlined in
      `docs/ops/watchdog_recommendations.md`, ensuring metrics land in `/metrics` before rollout.
   33. Finish the systemd inventory and security validator tooling, hook it into CI, and report on
      severity tallies so directive enforcement can move from draft to blocking.
   34. Replace placeholder owner identifiers in `maintenance_plan.md` with the active rotation and
      document the cadence review workflow.
   35. Wire up the documentation integrity verifier (`scripts/verify_docs_integrity.py`) in CI and
      update README/standards once enforcement is active.
   36. Update `repo_rollout_targets.md` status checkboxes using the latest faulthandler artifact
      runs and link to evidence.
   37. Add an automated refresh (Make target or scheduled job) for `mypy_agents_full.txt` and
      `mypy_monitoring_full.txt` so typing baselines stay current and documented.

## Concerns

* Instruction-heavy logs may mask strategic docs unless filtered.
* Each inventory run writes new `.txt` summaries, expanding scope without guardrails.
* Large `.ipynb` notebooks in `docs/` could inflate parsing cost; pre-rendering may help.

## Gaps to Investigate

* No consolidated index ties `docs/` and `.repo_studios/` yet, so cross-linking remains undefined.
* Retention or archival policy is undocumented, especially for generated health-suite outputs.
* Owner metadata is missing; filenames alone do not show stewardship.

## Next Steps

* Use the CSV inventory as the machine-parsable source for downstream bundling.
* Draft a filtering configuration (YAML or JSON) that maps directories and files to each analysis bundle.
* Prepare a follow-up report after proposing the bundling taxonomy; keep updates in this notes file.
