## 2025-10-01T17:40Z — Batch 1 (docs 1-25)

### Scope

* `.repo_prompts/prompt_whispering_v0.md`
* `.repo_session_alignment/ledger_setup_demo.md`
* `docs/voice_subsystem/README.md`
* `docs/ui/bench_ui_pre_commit.md`

* `memory-bank/productContext.md` *(no content change; verified availability)*
* `repo_rollout_targets.md`

### Alignment & Highlights

* Voice subsystem docs (latency SLO, queueing/collapse, resampler, Whisper prompt) give a coherent offline-first voice pipeline with traceable SLO and feature flag controls; matches Jarvis2 requirement for local execution.
* Memory governance set (MRP protocol, governance, daily ops, ownership matrices) reinforces Founder-Governed Protocol; confirms refresh tooling and access boundaries are documented end-to-end.
* Ledger template and memory-bank artifacts already model the alignment workflow we are adopting; decision log codifies continuity artifacts policy from 2025-09-19.
* Security hardening guidance aligns with air-gapped posture (kernel patch cadence, hardware attack surface mitigation) and dovetails with monitoring notes that emphasize voice metrics export readiness.
* repo rollout targets tie faulthandler artifacts back to CI gate expectations, providing measurable success criteria for diagnostics automation.

### Questions / Potential Gaps

* Voice docs reference aggregated metrics at `/metrics/voice`, but monitoring notes focus on generic KPI dashboards; need to confirm dashboards surface the new voice counters.
* Memory-bank `activeContext.md` still lists cache bypass/TTL stabilization work as the current goal—should be updated to reflect this documentation alignment cycle to avoid drift.
* `docs/ui/bench_ui_pre_commit.md` predates the latest Chainlit widget standards; check whether new UI hashing rules are incorporated elsewhere or if benchmarking guidance needs an appendix update.
* Security hardening checklist references 2025-06 kernel LTS; verify whether the September patches are applied and whether offline update procedure has an accompanying artifact.

### Next Actions

* Refresh memory-bank Active Context/Progress entries to reflect ledger-driven alignment effort and log resulting decisions once confirmed.
* Coordinate with monitoring owners to ensure voice metrics dashboards include the latency and collapse KPIs described in the voice SLO docs.
* Review UI benchmarking doc against current Chainlit standards and schedule an update if discrepancies remain after Batch 2.
* Validate faulthandler rollout evidence (blocklist/allowlist artifacts) before the mid-term milestone review.

## 2025-10-01T18:05Z — Batch 2 (docs/ entries 1-25)

### Scope (Batch 2)

* `docs/methodology_upgrades_2025-08.md`
* `docs/ui_readiness_checklist.md`
* `docs/coverage_ui.md`

### Alignment & Highlights (Batch 2)

* Fault owner signals plus operator checklists define measurable paging.
  Outcome aligns with monitoring KPIs recorded in repo health angles.
* Memory runbooks (daily ops, observability, staleness policy) reinforce MRP logging.
  Content matches refresh windows recorded in the TTL registry.
* Architecture overviews mirror the hardware blueprint and local-first orchestration.
  They reference interop optimization boundaries and network isolation rules.
* Interface testing and UI readiness docs codify Chainlit gates and diff coverage baselines.
  Standards tie back to methodology upgrades and coverage history metrics.
* Voice static scan plan plus README confirm offline voice posture.
  They restate pending `/metrics/voice` validation first flagged in Batch 1.

### Questions / Potential Gaps (Batch 2)

* Operator quickstart references legacy pager IDs; confirm they match the live roster.
* Staleness policy still cites 24h refresh while TTL registry shows shorter cache expirations.
* Demo UI snapshot predates widget hashing changes; verify newer screenshots exist.
* Interop optimization doc wants benchmark agent involvement without a success metric.

### Next Actions (Batch 2)

* Align operator quickstart tables and fault owner signals with current escalation contacts.
* Schedule TTL registry and staleness policy reconciliation to pick a single refresh cadence.
* Capture fresh Chainlit screenshots once hashing rules settle and update demo snapshot.
* Define interop benchmark KPI and add it to the repo health angles dashboard.

## 2025-10-01T18:20Z — Batch 3 (docs/ entries 26-50)

### Scope (Batch 3)

* `docs/decisions.md`
* `docs/api/lifecycle_snapshot.schema.json`
* `docs/health/degraded_detail.schema.json`

### Alignment & Highlights (Batch 3)

* Architecture master doc, cache migration roadmap, and ADR-0005 confirm cache facade sunset.
  They describe TTL governance and staged flag removal tied to hybrid storage.
* API factory and response contracts codify FastAPI middleware wiring and cache annotations.
  Error mapping guidance points to orchestrator PromQL playbooks for alert parity.
* Agent standards (tooling inventory, RAG, messaging, memory) enumerate safety flags.
  Guidance aligns with agents index taxonomy and event bus expectations.
* Fault diagnostics runbook plus artifact policy outline escalation flow and log retention.
  Decisions log governance mirrors the same rollback and evidence requirements.
* JSON schemas for lifecycle snapshot and degraded detail provide validation anchors.
  They clear the path for health endpoint contract testing.

### Questions / Potential Gaps (Batch 3)

* Cache migration plan lists placeholder feature flag names; confirm they match live config keys.
* RAG standards cite embed refresh cadence, yet PromQL catalog lacks matching metrics.
* Artifact policy predates hybrid storage retention experiments; verify it reflects new split.
* Decisions log ends mid-September; ensure recent ADR approvals appear there.

### Next Actions (Batch 3)

* Cross-check cache migration flag names against orchestrator config loader taxonomy.
* Propose Prometheus rule for memory embed refresh metrics and link it to RAG standards.
* Refresh artifact policy with hybrid storage thresholds and reference diagnostics retention.
* Sync decisions log with post-September ADR updates to maintain governance traceability.

## 2025-10-01T19:05Z — Batch 4 (docs entries 51-75)

### Scope (Batch 4)

* `docs/agents/llm_model_onboarding.md`
* `docs/agents/step4_chainlit_ui_plan.md`
* `docs/agents/step5_agent_config_system.md`

* `docs/standards_instructions_ai.md`
* `docs/agents/agent_frameworks_101.md`
* `docs/agents/hands_on_pairing_tracks.md`

### Alignment & Highlights (Batch 4)

* Agents plans (Steps 3-5) now align config, framework, and UI workstreams with concrete tests,
  flags, and MRP logging, giving us ready-to-run scaffolds plus checklists for telemetry gates.
* Repo insight workflow and startup runbook provide deterministic troubleshooting bundles and
  incident data collection, reinforcing the ledger-driven audit posture noted in prior batches.
* Service manifest spec introduces a declarative contract for lifecycle phases, agents, and
  feature flags; it matches current config loaders but requires validation tooling to go live.
* Voice conversation mode and privacy policy reaffirm offline defaults, retention, and
  subprocess guards, matching Batch 1 latency docs and closing the policy loop.
* Chat logging docs (core + redaction) and intent router guidance expose privacy controls,
  RAG toggles, and debug hooks that map cleanly to UI diagnostics and agent proposals.
* Monitoring overview and data collection plan document the metrics supply chain, ensuring
  cache, RAG, and orchestrator surfaces stay in sync with repo insight and diagnostic agents.
* Agent frameworks guide plus pairing tracks give hands-on templates to adopt LangChain,
  LangGraph, or bespoke loops with safe defaults, bridging planning docs to executor coaching.

### Questions / Potential Gaps (Batch 4)

* Service manifest spec is still draft; we need schema + validator to prevent drift before
  adoption in deployment tooling.
* Chat logging hardening mentions JSONL rotation, but retention overlap with voice logging
  policy is unspecified—should there be a shared cap?
* RAG status endpoint exposes staleness metrics, yet monitoring overview lacks matching alert
  rules; confirm if planned PromQL snippets cover it.
* AI standards roadmap references tooling (build scripts, diff CLI) that are not checked in;
  verify timeline or add placeholders to avoid confusion.

### Next Actions (Batch 4)

* Draft validation CLI for the service manifest and document integration points with config
  loader + deployment pipeline.
* Propose unified retention guidance for chat and voice logs so redaction docs and voice policy
  share the same rotation story.
* Add RAG status alert criteria to `docs/api/orchestrator_alerts.md` or monitoring runbooks to
  close the observability feedback loop.
* Follow up on AI standards roadmap deliverables (schema, build script) and track progress in
  the standards index to keep agents aligned with published timelines.

## 2025-10-01T20:10Z — Batch 5 (docs entries 76-100)

### Scope (Batch 5)

* `docs/api/orchestrator_overview.md`
* `docs/deep_dives/deep_dive_perf_cache_memory_voice.md`
* `docs/examples/minimal_service_config.md`
* `docs/ops/scale_out_systemd.md`

* `docs/metrics_schema.md`
* `docs/operations/preflight_checks.md`
* `docs/standards/doc_template.md`

### Alignment & Highlights (Batch 5)

* Orchestrator overview and the deep-dive on perf/cache/memory/voice stitch readiness, cache
  probes, and memory refresh diagnostics into one lifecycle narrative that matches the
  Makefile readiness targets called out in earlier batches.
* Minimal service config and scale-out systemd guide provide the baseline single-node manifest
  plus the deferred multi-instance deployment plan, aligning with the new service management
  addendum that introduced tiered readiness, agent registries, and shutdown snapshots.
* Node-RED and micro-agent roadmaps, together with ADR 0007 and ADR 0009, clarify how visual
  workflows and dynamic agent imports stay flag-gated, offline, and audit-backed; they tie
  into the monitoring roadmap and metrics schema to keep new surfaces observable.
* Monkey patch governance reiterates the risk taxonomy and ratchet tooling feeding the ledger,
  while ADRs 0001-0004 lock in streaming test policy, cache key segregation, negative cache
  handling, and diagnostic agent decomposition—directly supporting cache contracts and event
  bus primacy documentation.
* Metrics phase histogram design, metrics schema, lifecycle events, and preflight catalog add
  concrete schemas and naming contracts that agents and monitoring owners can rely on when
  wiring dashboards or health gates; the documentation template ensures future additions keep
  machine-parseable structure.

### Questions / Potential Gaps (Batch 5)

* Service management addendum is authoritative but still detached from the main phase doc; we
  need to merge content and ensure the new flags/tests are reflected in primary runbooks.
* ADR 0008 outlines the deprecation lifecycle yet leaves rationale, consequences, and
  observability sections unfinished—clarify before agents depend on the policy.
* Scale-out systemd plan remains placeholder heavy ("defer" markers) and lacks acceptance
  criteria for the multi-node orchestration; assign owner and target milestone.
* Node-RED roadmap still lists offline asset bundling and diff UI upgrades as gaps; confirm
...

## 2025-10-02T06:25Z — Docs Phase Automation (Meta)

### Scope

Focused meta-documentation improvements (not a content batch review):

* Added inventory filtering & pre‑tag bundle: `docs_inventory_config.yaml` — new `batch10_seed` bundle.
* Introduced retention governance draft: `docs/standards/clean_log_retention.md`.
* Added mypy baseline refresh automation: `scripts/mypy_refresh_baselines.py` +
  `make mypy-refresh-baselines` target.
* Linked retention + baseline refresh workflow into `README.md` and `docs/standards/documentation.md`.

### Outcomes

* Transient health-suite noise excluded from future inventories (baseline bundle unchanged).
* Retention policy drafted (status: Draft) — awaiting governance approval before enforcement tooling.
* Baseline refresh is non-blocking; prepares ground for future type drift gates without adding CI latency.
* Integrity verifier (`scripts/verify_docs_integrity.py`) referenced in README near
  future `content_hash` rollout.

### Pending / Next Steps

* Implement retention housekeeping script (`scripts/clean_log_retention.py`) + Make target (dry-run default).
* Add `content_hash` fields to governed docs and enable strict verification in CI.
* Consider adding a summary JSON for baseline type drift deltas (future enhancement).
* Update governance status of retention policy after approval (promote Draft -> Active).

### Ledger Notes

This entry records automation scaffolding separate from doc content review batches to
maintain a clear audit boundary between content alignment and tooling enablement.
  timelines or create interim mitigation so editors know current limitations.
* Metrics schema version 4 and phase histogram design reference future alerts, but monitoring
  roadmap does not enumerate them yet—close the loop so PromQL catalog reflects new counters.

### Next Actions (Batch 5)

* Integrate the service management addendum updates into `step6_service_management_scripts.md`
  and add targeted readiness/shutdown tests once the refactor lands.
* Complete ADR 0008 by drafting rationale, consequences, observability, and rollback sections,
  then update the decisions log to record acceptance details.
* Flesh out the scale-out systemd roadmap with concrete acceptance criteria, owner, and flag
  strategy so the deferred work can be scheduled.
* Track Node-RED roadmap TODOs (offline asset bundle, diff UX v2) in the standards/roadmap
  backlog and link status in the ledger once resolved.
* Align monitoring roadmap, metrics schema, and metrics/phase design docs by adding PromQL
  snippets or alert definitions for the newly documented counters and histograms.

## 2025-10-01T21:05Z — Batch 6 (docs entries 101-125)

### Scope (Batch 6)

* `docs/standards/glossary.md`
* `docs/extending/warmers.md`
* `docs/standards/lifecycle_versioning_policy.md`
* `docs/standards/testing.md`
* `docs/storage_conventions.md`

* `docs/standards/coding.md`
* `docs/standards/repo_standards_models.md`
* `docs/standards/documentation.md`
* `docs/standards/file_tree.md`

### Alignment & Highlights (Batch 6)

* Standards suite (glossary, coding/testing/documentation/file-tree) plus lifecycle versioning
  and additive observability policies establish a coherent contract for naming, version bumps,
  and drift guards that reinforce earlier governance batches.
* Voice quickstart, meeting mode, intent router, and contract suite close the loop on guarded
  voice features—linking configuration flags, contract markers, and privacy/logging requirements
  surfaced in prior batches.
* Operations docs (flag matrix, restart policy, shutdown, test flag safety, exit code stability)
  map environment knobs to lifecycle phases and define restart/exit semantics aligned with the
  upcoming service manifest enforcement work.
* RAG endpoints doc and MRP README tie memory refresh operations to observable `/rag/status`
  surfaces and headers, while metrics inventory + additive policy anchor the new lifecycle
  counters and histograms referenced in Batch 5 monitoring materials.
* Agent startup contract and config inventory clarify registry schema, enablement flags, and
  readiness expectations feeding Step 5 plans; faulthandler guidance and warmers extension notes
  back existing operational tooling.

### Questions / Potential Gaps (Batch 6)

* Warmers extension guide defines proposed contracts but lacks the promised registry helper and
  timeout/metrics enforcement—needs alignment with lifecycle metrics inventory.
* Lifecycle versioning and additive observability policies remain drafts without wired drift
  guard tests or documented hash enforcement; schedule implementation details.
* Restart policy references placeholder supervisor flags (`SUP_RESTART_*`) that do not yet
  exist—clarify ownership and integration timeline.
* RAG endpoints doc outlines headers/status but no alerting or SLO references; ensure monitoring
  roadmap captures these signals.
* Test flag safety and exit code policies label certain codes/flags as non-stable but do not
  describe rollout/deprecation plans; need follow-on ADR or enforcement strategy.

### Next Actions (Batch 6)

* Finalize warmer contract by documenting registry helper usage, default timeouts, and link
  metrics (`warmer_duration_seconds`) into lifecycle metrics inventory + tests.
* Implement lifecycle/additive observability drift guards (hash snapshots + CI checks) and update
  docs with enforcement locations once live.
* Define supervisor restart env flags, owners, and acceptance tests so restart policy moves from
  placeholder to actionable guidance.
* Extend monitoring roadmap with `/rag/status` thresholds and `X-RAG-*` header sampling guidance,
  then add alert snippets to the lifecycle metrics inventory.
* Document migration/strict-mode plan for dangerous/test-only flags and the exit code table,
  including update cadence and references in `docs/decisions.md`.

## 2025-10-01T22:55Z — Voice & Diagnostics Follow-Up (Focused Revisions)

### Scope — Voice & Diagnostics

* `docs/voice/latency_slo.md`
* `docs/monitoring_notes.md`
* `docs/voice_privacy_logging_policy.md`
* `docs/api/chat_logging.md`
* `docs/faulthandler.md`
* `repo_rollout_targets.md`
* `docs/ui/bench_ui_pre_commit.md`

### Alignment & Highlights — Voice Metrics & Tooling

* Voice latency SLO now captures concrete targets, an interim measurement plan, and `/metrics/voice`
  gating details; monitoring notes link directly to the SLO so operators discover flag context.
* Voice privacy policy and chat logging docs share a 30-day retention baseline, clarifying how
  JSONL backups and rotation settings keep parity across modalities.
* Faulthandler guide records the 2025-09-29 artifact drop, and the rollout targets ledger marks
  FT-ST readiness complete with evidence pointers for future audits.
* UI pre-commit benchmarking checklist re-establishes the workflow around `bench_ui_*` scripts
  so local runs mirror CI’s `make ui` gate.

### Questions / Potential Gaps — Voice Follow-Up

* Latency SLO assumes forthcoming histogram metrics (`voice_transcribe_latency_ms_bucket`) and
  queue depth gauges—need follow-up once instrumentation lands.
* Retention alignment still depends on operators honoring rotation settings; consider adding a
  shared enforcement script or CI check.
* Faulthandler mid/long-term criteria remain unchecked; trend dashboards and gate automation are
  still pending.
* UI benchmarking doc references optional artifact cleanup; clarify expectations for when to
  commit `perf_history/` changes in PR templates.

### Next Actions — Voice Follow-Up

* Implement voice latency histograms and queue depth metrics, then update SLO notes with metric
  names and alert thresholds.
* Add retention verification to the logging maintenance scripts so chat/voice parity is enforced.
* Capture mid-/long-term faulthandler evidence (trend reductions, gate enforcement) before the
  next diagnostics review.
* Update PR guidelines to specify when benchmark artifacts must accompany UI changes, aligning
  with the new pre-commit checklist.

## 2025-10-01T22:15Z — Batch 7 (docs entries 126-150)

* `docs/standards/markdown.md`
* `docs/agents/config_quickstart.md`
* `docs/ops/logging_strategy.md`
* `docs/ops/restart_policy.md`

### Alignment & Highlights (Batch 7)

* UI memory widget guidance locks in single-message updates, metrics
  (`ui_memory_search_total`), and staleness prompts that mirror Chainlit
  standards already documented in Batch 4. Keeps the interface in step with
  memory API contracts.
* Lifecycle startup benchmark guide dovetails with the Phase 6 service
  management work—targets, cold/warm methodology, and artifact expectations
  align with the new lifecycle metrics emitted by `service_start.py`.
* Step 6 service management plan chronicles rapid progress: manifest
  validation, preflight registry, API start gating, warmer registry, lifecycle
  metrics/MRP events, debug dumps, and histogram exposure. The doc now mirrors
  instrumentation in the codebase.
* Chat headers/correlation docs document deterministic observability headers,
  retry metrics, and correlation IDs that match the standardized error
  envelope used across the API and UI.
* Startup debug dump spec, service management testing strategy, and
  logging/restart policies show a coherent lifecycle ops stack—structured
  artifacts, layered tests, JSON logging mode, and restart precedence all
  reference the same session id semantics.
* Ledger overview, metrics storage path update, standards archive snapshot,
  docs index, and drift guard matrix reinforce provenance and governance
  baselines introduced in earlier batches.
* Agent template, events, shared state, and config quickstart docs align agent
  scaffolding with the EventBus bridge, state persistence, registry reload
  metrics, and quickstart workflows, matching our earlier agent framework
  plans.
* Observability roadmap, known issues tracker, systemd inventory governance,
  and logging strategy tie lifecycle instrumentation and maintenance
  orchestrator guidance into the broader governance story (roadmaps,
  manifests, hash integrity, session-scoped logs).

### Questions / Potential Gaps (Batch 7)

* Service management plan still lists follow-on work (per-warmer timeouts,
  manifest-driven warmers, lifecycle metrics wiring into `/metrics`
  verification); confirm the latest code exposes those metrics as documented.
* Lifecycle startup benchmarks target automation (cold/warm segregation, phase
  histogram doc) that remains future work; assign ownership once metrics land.
* Events guide duplicates ACL/redaction sections; a clarity pass would reduce
  repetition and keep the security guidance single-sourced.
* Known issues tracker holds a single entry; governance expectations likely need
  more issues or triage workflow detail before this becomes actionable.
* Systemd inventory governance describes integrity manifest and blocking target
  as “planned”; validate when `systemd-inventory-check` promotion occurs and
  track manifest implementation.
* Startup debug dump spec calls for automated generation on strict failures plus
  diff tooling—those hooks are still pending.

### Next Actions (Batch 7)

* Verify lifecycle metrics emitted by the orchestrator match the documented
  names/labels and are scraped under `/metrics`, adding tests or docs updates as
  needed.
* Schedule ownership for lifecycle startup benchmark automation (cold vs warm
  segregation, phase histogram doc) and link it to the observability roadmap.
* Deduplicate the ACL/redaction guidance in `docs/agents/events.md` so security
  guidance remains canonical and easier to maintain.
* Expand the known issues tracker with active issues or define the intake
  workflow so operators can rely on it during incidents.
* Implement the systemd inventory integrity manifest and drift check target,
  then document the path to blocking enforcement.
* Hook startup debug dump generation into the orchestrator (flag + automatic
  failure capture) and deliver the planned diff helper script/documentation.

## 2025-10-02T16:45Z — Batch 8 (docs entries 151-175)

### Scope (Batch 8)

* `docs/ops/systemd_inventory.md`
* `docs/ops/systemd_security_profile.md`
* `docs/adr/README.md`
* `docs/ops/watchdog_recommendations.md`

### Alignment & Highlights (Batch 8)

* Systemd inventory baseline, gap report, and classification heuristics now sit
  alongside the security profile matrix, giving us both coverage telemetry and
  sandbox expectations for Phase 6/7 rollout planning.
* Security profile codifies directive severities, override rationale headers,
  and transition criteria so the planned validator can move from report-only to
  blocking once watchdog integration stabilizes.
* ADR index reaffirms numbering discipline and cross-link requirements between
  ADRs and `docs/decisions.md`, keeping governance traceable as new records are
  added.
* Watchdog & heartbeat recommendations extend the Phase 7 plan with explicit
  metrics, staged rollout steps, alert thresholds, and shim removal criteria
  that dovetail with the restart and security policies reviewed earlier in this
  batch.

### Questions / Potential Gaps (Batch 8)

* Systemd inventory and security profile both depend on yet-to-be-delivered
  validators; enforcement timelines remain estimates until tooling lands.
* ADR index omits recently accepted records (e.g., 0004, 0005, 0007-0009);
  confirm whether numbering changed or the index needs a refresh.
* Watchdog recommendations rely on new metrics counters and gauges that do not
  yet exist in code or PromQL catalogs; baseline and alert wiring are pending.
* Shim deprecation plan references ADR work that has not been drafted; we need
  ownership before setting retirement dates.

### Next Actions (Batch 8)

* Implement and integrate the systemd security validator (`scripts/validate_systemd_security.py`)
  and wire it into CI in report-only mode before promoting to blocking.
* Refresh the ADR index so all numbered decisions currently in the repo appear
  with status and links, and update `docs/decisions.md` accordingly.
* Coordinate with monitoring owners to add watchdog/heartbeat metrics exports
  plus baseline PromQL rules and alert thresholds described in the
  recommendations doc.
* Define the watchdog shim retirement ADR and track python-systemd availability
  so Stage 5 removal criteria can be scheduled confidently.

## 2025-10-02T17:25Z — Batch 9 (jarvis2/ root docs)

### Scope (Batch 9)

* `CONTRIBUTING.md`
* `README.md`
* `RELEASE_NOTES.md`
* `backlog_tasks.md`
* `chainlit.md`
* `completion_report.md`
* `repo_dependency_exceptions.md`
* `repo_prompt_engineering_standards.md`
* `repo_prompts.md`
* `repo_rollout_targets.md`
* `latest.md`
* `maintenance_plan.md`
* `mypy_agents_full.txt`
* `mypy_monitoring_full.txt`
* `perf_summary.md`
* `perf_trend.md`
* `requirements-dev.txt`
* `retro.md`
* `security_hardening.md`
* `systemd_gap_report.md`

### Alignment & Highlights (Batch 9)

* README establishes the governed documentation map, anchor health tooling, and the
  agent config metrics rollout, tying earlier batches’ subsystem docs into a single
  entry point with explicit Make targets for drift detection.
* Release notes capture the additive caching middleware, UI data endpoint hashes,
  conversation/meeting feature flags, and lifecycle metrics refinements, giving
  concrete evidence that the roadmap items reviewed in prior batches landed in code
  with tests and rollout guidance.
* Contributing, requirements-dev, and the bundled mypy reports codify the local test
  workflow, coverage gate expectations, and typing baselines, reinforcing quality
  gates already referenced in monitoring and standards docs.
* Maintenance plan, completion report, retro, and latest update provide an audit trail
  from Step 3 completion through Step 30 maintenance ownership, ensuring operational
  cadence, metrics targets, and retrospective learnings stay linked to the ledger
  effort.
* Security hardening, systemd gap report, and dependency exceptions align the hardening
  directives, inventory scores, and temporary layering shims, matching the validator
  plans and watchdog recommendations recorded in Batch 8.
* repo prompt standards, prompt library, and rollout targets supply the AI agent
  guardrails and diagnostic success criteria that underpin the governance mindset
  captured in earlier ledger batches.
* Perf summary/trend affirm the performance harness metrics referenced across the
  completion report and release notes, providing concrete baselines for future drift
  scans.

### Questions / Potential Gaps (Batch 9)

* Maintenance plan still lists placeholder owner identifiers; real assignments need to
  be captured before the cadence matrix can be enforced.
* README references forthcoming `content_hash` enforcement and integrity scripts that
  are not yet present; timeline for `scripts/verify_docs_integrity.py` activation is
  unspecified.
* Release notes enumerate new watchdog metrics and cache counters, but monitoring
  docs and PromQL catalog still lack the matching alert rules flagged in Batch 8.
* repo rollout targets track success criteria, yet no status checkboxes are marked;
  progress tracking needs to be updated to reflect current phase completion.
* `mypy_agents_full.txt` and `mypy_monitoring_full.txt` are static snapshots; guidance
  on refresh cadence or automation is absent, risking drift.

### Next Actions (Batch 9)

* Populate the maintenance plan role table with actual owner names and update the
  cadence matrix once confirmed.
* Schedule implementation and CI wiring for the documentation integrity verifier and
  record its enforcement point in README and standards docs when live.
* Extend monitoring alert docs (`docs/api/orchestrator_alerts.md` / PromQL catalog) to
  include the watchdog/cache metrics introduced in the latest release notes.
* Update `repo_rollout_targets.md` with current checklist status and link to recent
  faulthandler runs to prove short-term criteria coverage.
* Define an automated refresh process for the mypy full reports (e.g., Make target or
  scheduled job) so typing baselines remain current and documented.
