# About this folder

To reduce confusion with the root-level `README.md`, the detailed guide for AI
agents and contributors has been moved to `AGENTS_GUIDE.md` in this same folder.

* Canonical guide: `./AGENTS_GUIDE.md` (see “repo scripts overview”)
* Markdown standards: `./repo_standards_markdown.md`
* Other standards: `repo_standards_*.md`, `repo_studios_clean.md`,
  `repo_mission_parameters.md`
* Anchor health governance: run `make anchor-health` for duplicate heading metrics (artifacts in `./anchor_health/`).

This stub exists only to point humans and tools to the canonical guide file and
the standards.
