    Baseline filters for documentation inventory exports.
    Excludes transient health-suite artifacts generated by automated runs.
filters:
  global_excludes:
    - glob: ".repo_studios/health_suite/**"
      rationale: "Health suite artifacts are ephemeral status outputs and should not inflate documentation counts."
bundles:
  - name: baseline
    include:
      - "**/*"
    exclude:
      - ".repo_studios/health_suite/**"
    notes: "Baseline inventory with transient health-suite artifacts removed."
  - name: batch10_seed
    include:
      - "docs/ci_fault_owner_signals.md"
      - "docs/memory/**"
      - "memory-bank/**"
    exclude: []
    notes: "Pre-tag bundle for upcoming Batch 10 parsing focus (fault signals + memory docs)."
